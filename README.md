# Cabinetry Site Preview

Single-file demo you can host on GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (public or private).
2. Upload these files or `git push` this folder.
3. In repo **Settings â†’ Pages**, set **Branch** to your default (often `main`) and **Folder** = `/ (root)`.
4. After Pages builds, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Notes
